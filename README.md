 If the wheel speeds and the radius (R) of a two-wheeled differentially steered robot are known, its position can be obtained using the kinematic equations derived in the lectures. Consider a case where the robot starts at (x, y) = (0, 0), heading in the positive x direction (φ = 0) as shown in the figure.

Assuming that the wheel speeds vary as

LaTeX: v_L(t) = v_0(t/t_1) v L ( t ) = v 0 ( t / t 1 )

LaTeX: v_R(t) = v_0(t/t_2) v R ( t ) = v 0 ( t / t 2 )

where LaTeX: v_0 v 0 , LaTeX: t_1 t 1 , and LaTeX: t_2 t 2 are constants, derive analytically a general expression for the position (x, y) and heading φ for the robot, as a function of time, and plot the resulting trajectory in your report (e.g. using Matlab), for t ∈ [0, 10] for the case R = 0.12 m, LaTeX: v_0 v 0 = 0.5 m/s, LaTeX: t_1 t 1 = 10 s and LaTeX: t_2 t 2 = 5 s.
